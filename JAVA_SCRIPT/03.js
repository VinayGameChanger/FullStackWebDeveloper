// Rules for Naming Variables


//You cannot start with a number
//example
// var 1value=5;(invalid)
// var value1=5;  //(valid)
// console.log(value1);

//You can use underscore as well as $ dollar symbol
var first_name = "vinay";//snake case writting
var first$name = "sunny";
var firstName = "ajay";//camel case writting
console.log(first_name);
console.log(first$name);
console.log(firstName);

//convention

//use always camelcase and start varibles with small letters
