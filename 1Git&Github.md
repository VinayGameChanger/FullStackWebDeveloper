What is version Control?
>A size of developer written code can be from 1kb to 100s and 1000s of files, millions of lines of code.
>As time paases it becomes super difficult to track who is making change & where?
>Even a single character mistake can break the entire software.
>Developers come and go, code stays forever in the company.
>I don’t know or don’t remember when a change was done in this file / folder is not something that a software team / company can afford. 
>Hence to track changes in the source code of program from the beginning to years, we need some powerful tool that show us the history of the entire code.
